Git :

Git is an open-source distributed version control system. It is designed to handle minor to major projects with high speed and efficiency. It is developed to co-ordinate the work among the developers. The version control allows us to track and work together with our team members at the same workspace.

GitHub :

 GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration. GitHub’s interface is user-friendly enough so even novice coders can take advantage of Git. Without GitHub, using Git generally requires a bit more technical savvy and use of the command line.

What Is Version Control?

 Version control helps developers track and manage changes to a software project’s code. As a software project grows, version control becomes essential. Take WordPress… At this point, WordPress is a pretty big project. If a core developer wanted to work on one specific part of the WordPress codebase, it wouldn’t be safe or efficient to have them directly edit the “official” source code. Instead, version control lets developers safely work through branching and merging.

what is repositary?

A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository. When you create a repository, you can choose to make the repository public or private. Repositories in organizations that use GitHub Enterprise Cloud and are owned by an enterprise account can also be created with internal visibility.

How are softwares are using github?

 Git is used to tracking changes in the source code. The distributed version control tool is used for source code management. It allows multiple developers to work together. It supports non-linear development through its thousands of parallel branches.


some exampular programs......


1. Write a program to convert a floating 
point into correspondig integer .                                                                                                 

#Python program to add two numbers 

number1 = input("First number: ") 
number2 = input("Second number: ") 
 
# Adding two numbers 
# User might also enter float numbers 

sum = float(number1) + float(number2) 

 # Display the sum 
# will print value in float 

print("The sum of {0} and {1} is {2}" 
      .format(number1, number2, sum))

output:
First number:  7
Second number: 9
The sum of 7 and 9 is 15.0



2.write the program to calculate area of a triangle using heron's formula.
#area of traingle using heron's formula

a=float(input("enter the first side of triangle:"))
b=float(input("enter the second side of traingle:"))
c=float(input("enter the third side of triangle:"))
print(a,b,c)
s = (a+b+c)/2
area= (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c))**0.5
print("area="+str(area))

output:
enter the first side of traingle:12
enter the second side of triangle: 18
enter the third side of triangle: 10
12.0 18.0 10.0
area = 56.5685424949




3.write a program to convert degrees Fahrenheit into degrees Celsius.
#convert Fahrenheit to Celsius

fahrenheit=float(input("Enter the temperature in fahrenheit:")
celsius=(0.56)*(fahrenheit-32)
print("temperature in degrees Celsius=",celsius)

output:
Enter the temperature in fahrenheit:104.3
temperature in degrees celsius=40.488



4.write a program to swap two variables.
# Python program to swap two variables

x = 5
y = 10
#x = input('Enter value of x: ')
#y = input('Enter value of y: ')

temp = x
x = y
y = temp

print('The value of x after swapping: {}'.format(x))
print('The value of y after swapping: {}'.format(y))

output:
The value of x after swapping:10
The value of y after swapping:5




5.write a program to calculate the square root of a number.
# Python Program to calculate the square root

num = 4
num = float(input('Enter a number: '))
num_sqrt = num ** 0.5
print('The square root of %0.1f is %0.1f'%(num ,num_sqrt))

output:
The square root of 4.0 is 2.0



6.write a program to check if the number is even or odd.
# to check number is even or odd

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if (num % 2) == 0:
   print("%0 is Even".format(num))
else:
   print("%0 is Odd".format(num))

output:
Enter a number:5
5 is odd




7.write a program to write factorial of a given number.
# to find the factorial of a number 

num = 7

factorial = 1

if num < 0:
   print("Sorry, factorial does not exist for negative numbers")
elif num == 0:
   print("The factorial of 0 is 1")
else:
   for i in range(1,num + 1):
       factorial = factorial*i
   print("The factorial of",num,"is",factorial)

Output: The factorial of 7 is 5040



8.  Write a program to write sum of natural numbers.
# to find sum of natural numbers

num = 10

if num < 0:
   print("Enter a positive number")
else:
   sum = 0
   while(num > 0):
       sum += num
       num -= 1
   print("The sum is", sum)

Output:
The sum is 55



9. Write a program to test whether a number is negative, positive,or equal to zero.
num=int(input ("enter any number: "))
if (num ==0):
   print ("Number=0")
elif (num> 0):
   print("The number is positive")
else:
   print ("The number is negative")

output:
Enter any number:-121
The number is negative



10. write a Program to print the digit at one's place of number.

num=int(input("enter any number: ")
digitat_ones_Place_=num% 10
print ("The digit at ones place of " + str(num) + " + str(digit_at_ones_place))

output:
Enter any number: 1345 
The digit at ones place of 1345 is 5
